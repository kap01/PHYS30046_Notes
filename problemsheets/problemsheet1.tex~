\NewQuestion{
This question is about Feynman diagrams in QED. To answer this you can follow the solved example in your notes.}
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Draw a Feynman diagram for each of the  QED processes $e^+e^-\to \mu^+\mu^-$ and $e^+e^-\to q\bar{q}$ clearly labelling the vertex factors of the processes. The symbols  $q$ and $\bar{q}$ denote a quark and anti-quark with electric charge $\pm e_q$. 
\item By assuming that the Centre-Of-Mass energy of both processes are the same and ignoring the masses of all the particles involved, show that the matrix elements squared of the two processes are related by \[
\left |\frac{\mathcal{M}_{\mu\mu}}{\mathcal{M}_{q\bar{q}}}\right |^{2} = \frac{e^2}{e_{q}^{2}}
\]
\item What is the physical meaning of $|\mathcal{M}_{\mu\mu}|^{2}$ and $|\mathcal{M}_{q\bar{q}}|^{2}$

\NewQuestion{This question is about basic 4-vector manipulation}
You are given two 4-vectors
\[U=(u_0,\vec{u})\] and
\[Y=(y_0,\vec{y})\]
You are given that the opening angle between $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{y}$ is $\theta$. 
Write down an expression of $U\cdot Y$ in terms of $\theta$, $u_0$, $y_0$, $|\vec{u}|$ and $|\vec{y}|$.
\answerbox{
Following the definition of 4-vector dot products
\[
U\cdot Y= u_0y_0-\vec{u}\cdot\vec{y}
\]
Following the definition of 3-vector dot products
\[
U\cdot Y= u_0y_0-|\vec{u}||\vec{y}|cos\theta
\]
}

\NewQuestion{This question is about basic 4-vector Lorentz Transformations}
You are given two 4-vectors in frame $S$.
\[U=(u_0,\vec{u})\] and
\[Y=(y_0,\vec{y})\]
 Lets now consider a frame $S'$ moving with constant velocity along the $x$ direction with $\beta=v/c$. 
 By considering how the various components of $U$ and $Y$ transform under a Lorentz Transformation along the $x$-axis, show that the quantity $U\cdot Y$ is invariant under this transformation
\answerbox{
\[U^{'}\cdot Y^{'}=U_{0}^{'}Y_{0}^{'}-U_{x}^{'}Y_{x}^{'}-U_{y}^{'}Y_{y}^{'}-U_{z}^{'}Y_{z}^{'}
\]
But boost only along the $x$ axis so 
\[
U_{0}^{'}=\gamma U_0-\beta\gamma U_x,\\
U_{x}^{'}=-\beta\gamma U_0+\gamma U_x,\\
U_{y}^{'}=U_{y},\\
U_{z}^{'}=U_{z}
\]

So inserting into equation we have
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
U^{'}\cdot Y^{'}&=\gamma^2U_0Y_0(1-\beta^2)-     \\ &\quad\gamma^2U_xY_x(1-\beta^2)-\gamma^2\beta U_0Y_x- \\ 
&\gamma^2\beta U_xY_0+\beta^2\gamma^2U_xY_x+\beta\gamma^2U_0Y_x+\\
&\beta\gamma^2U_xY_0-U_{y}Y_{y}-U_{z}Y_{z}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Remembering that $\gamma^2=\frac{1}{1-\beta^2}$ and cancelling common terms
\[
U^{'}\cdot Y^{'}=U_0Y_0-U_xY_x-U_yY_y-U_{z}Y_{z}
\]

\NewQuestion{This question is about relativistic  kinematics}

Show that the energy momentum relationship
\[ E^2=p^2c^2+m^2c^4\] follows from the expressions $E=\gamma m c^2$ and $p=\gamma mv$ 
Hint: start from  $\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ and solve for $v$. Then insert this expression for v into $p=\gamma mv$
\answerbox{Start by using the expression of $\gamma$ to solve for $v$ and get 
\[v=\sqrt{(\gamma^2-1)}c/\gamma\]
Inserting this expression into $p=\gamma mv$ we have that \[p=mc\sqrt{\gamma^2-1}\] and thus
\[\gamma=\sqrt{p^2/(m^2c^2)+1}\]. Inserting this into $E=\gamma mc$ we have that
\[
E^2=(p^2/(m^2c^2)+1)m^2c^4
\]
and thus
\[
E^2=p^2c^2+m^2c^4
\]

\NewQuestion{This question is about applying relativistic particle kinematics to various particle collider examples}

What are the Centre of Mass energies of the following particle accelerator facilities?
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item LEP1: $e^+e^-$ collider both beams at 45.6~GeV. \\If we wanted to produce a $Z^0$-boson of mass 91.2~GeV$/c^2$ AND a Higgs-boson of mass 125~GeV$/c^2$ simultaneously from an $e^+e^-$ collision, what is the minimum centre of mass energy required?
\item LHC: $pp$ collider both beams at 7~TeV
\item HERA: $ep$ collider $E_e=30$~GeV and $E_p=920$~GeV. If HERA was to collide instead electrons onto protons of a stationary target, what would the required electron beam energy be in order to achieve the same centre of mass energy?
\end{enumerate}
You can assume $m_e=0.5$~MeV$/c^2$ and $m_p=1$~GeV$/c^2$.
\answerbox{

For colliders where the beam energies are equal (ie cases (i) and (ii))

$\vec{p}_{1}+\vec{p}_{2}=0$. That means that given the definition of the centre-of-mass energy
\[
\sqrt{s}=\sqrt{(E_1+E_2)^2-(\vec{p}_1+\vec{p}_2)^2}=E_1+E_2
\]
Therefore for \\
(i) $\sqrt{s}=2\times 45.6=91.2$GeV\\
The minimum energy required required to produce a Higgs-boson of mass 125GeV/$c^2$ corresponds to the case when the Higgs-boson and the $Z^0$ are produced at rest. Therefore the minimum energy required would be equal to the rest-energy of the Higgs and $Z^0$ combined, ie $\sqrt{s}_{min}=m_{H}c^2+m_{Z^0}c^2=91.2+125$GeV

(ii) $\sqrt{s}=2\times 7=14$TeV\\

(iii) Here $E_e=30$GeV and $E_p=920$GeV. Therefore $|p_e|=\sqrt{E_e^2-m_e^2}\sim E_e=30$GeV. Similarly,  $|p_p|=\sqrt{E_p^2-m_p^2}\sim E_p=920$GeV.
So
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\sqrt{s}=&\sqrt{(E_e+E_p)^2-(\vec{p}_e+\vec{p}_p)^2}\\
=& \sqrt{E_{e}^{2}+E_{p}^{2}+2E_eE_p-|\vec{p}_e|^{2}-|\vec{p}_p|^{2}-2\vec{p}_e\vec{p}_pcos\pi}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

where we have taken the angle between the two beams as $\pi$ as they are colliding head on. Given we can approximate $E$ with $|p|$ as the beam energies are much larger than rest masses we have
\[
\sqrt{s}\sim\sqrt{4E_eE_p}\sim332\mathrm{GeV}
\]

Now for a fixed target configuration, from our notes we have that 
\[
E_e\sim \frac{s}{2m_p}
\]
for the case when $\sqrt{s}\gg m_e,m_p$ which is indeed the case in this problem.
Therefore $E_e\sim 55$TeV in order to reach $\sqrt{s}=332$GeV in a fixed target configuration

\NewQuestion{This question is about relativistic kinematics}
A $B^0$ meson is a bound state between an anti-$b$ and a $d$ quark and has a mass of $5.28$~GeV$/c^2$. The average time before the $B^0$ decays (ie its mean life-time) is 1.5~ps (1~ps=1$\times 10^{-12}$~s). Given that the average momentum of the $B^0$ meson as measured by the ``LHC beauty'' (LHCb) experiment is 100~GeV$/c$, calculate the average distance it travels before it decays, as measured by the experimenters.
\answerbox{
Average momentum of the $B^0$ is given by
\[
<|\vec{p}_{B}|>=\gamma m_B<v_B>
\]
And average displacement is
\[
<d_B>=<v_B>t_B
\]
Where $t_B$ is the lifetime in the lab frame. However $t_B=\gamma\tau_B$ where $\tau_B$ is the average lifetime of the $B$ in its rest frame (proper lifetime).
Therefore using the expression of the average momentum above we have
\[
<d_B>=<|\vec{p}_{B}|>/m_B\times \tau_B = \frac{100{\rm GeV/c}}{5.28{\rm GeV/c^2}}\times1.5\times10^{-12}{\rm s}
\]
Thus $<d_B>=\frac{100}{5.28}c1.5\times10^{-12}=0.0085$m

\NewQuestion{This question is about the continuity equation of the K-G equation}
The Klein-Gordon (K-G) is given by:
given by:
\[
\left(\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial
  t^{2}}-\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}} -
  \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y^{2}} - \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial z^{2}}\right)\psi+m^{2}\psi=0.
\]
with solutions of the form: 
\[
\psi=Ne^{i(\vec{p}\cdot\vec{r}-Et)},
\]
where $N$ is a complex normalisation factor. The solutions describe
states with energies:
  \[E=\pm\sqrt{|\vec{p}|^2+m^2}.\]
 Show that the continuity
  equation is given by
  \[
     \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{j}=0,
  \]
with
\[
   \rho = i\left[\psi^*\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}-\frac{\partial\psi^*}{\partial t}\psi\right],
\]
and
\[
   \vec{j} = -i\left[\psi^*(\vec{\nabla}\psi)-(\vec{\nabla}\psi^*)\psi\right].
   \]
   Hint: Multiply the K-G equation by $\psi^*$ and subtracting it from
   the complex conjugate K-G equation multiplied by $\psi$
